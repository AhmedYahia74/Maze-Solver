# Maze-Solver

Maze-Solver is a Python-based maze-solving game implemented using Tkinter. The game allows users to place a rat and a piece of cheese on a grid, and then find paths between them using various algorithms. 

## Features
- Place a rat and cheese on the grid.
- Generate random mazes with obstacles.
- Solve the maze using algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Greedy Best-First Search, A*, and Limited DFS.
- Reset the grid to start over.
- Watch a demo video to see the game in action.
